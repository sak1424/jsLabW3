   JavaScript — Week 3 — Lab 1 · Exercise 4 (objects)  [BARE-SPEC]
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   TASK
     1. let student = new Object();
        student.name = "Sokha"; student.age = 20;
     2. student.major = "Computer Science";
     3. student["favorite subject"] = "Math";  (bracket notation —
        needed for multi-word keys)
     4. student.age = 21;   (update)
     5. Add student.temp = anything, then delete it.
     6. hasMajor = "major" in student   → true
        hasTemp  = "temp"  in student   → false
     7. for...in → build one string `studentInfo` of "key: value"
        pairs joined by ", " (same trick as exercise 3).
     8. Print student.major, student["favorite subject"], hasMajor,
        hasTemp, studentInfo.

   EXPECTED OUTPUT
     major: Computer Science
     favorite subject: Math
     hasMajor: true
     hasTemp: false
     studentInfo: name: Sokha, age: 21, major: Computer Science, favorite subject: Math
